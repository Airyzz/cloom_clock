## How to Run

If you wish to run this project locally you'll have to first clone the auxiliary project of Google [Flutter Clock](https://github.com/flutter/flutter_clock) ( https://github.com/flutter/flutter_clock ) and then clone this project inside the main project so it has the following folder stucture:

```
/flutter_clock/
|--/flutter_clock_helper/
|--/cloom_clock/
```

This project relies on the code provided by the folder `/flutter_clock_helper`

## Project

This is the clock made with Flutter for the [Flutter 2020 clock](https://flutter.dev/clock) contest with colaboration with Francisco Frutuoso and code by Filipe Barroso
